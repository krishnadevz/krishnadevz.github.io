# About Me üìù

* I have always enjoyed doing creative things, and I still do that today. Some of those things are photography, music, movies, travel, writing, art, filming videos, and designing.

* On my Instagram, you'll find a collection of visual storytelling, including photographs, short films, and written musings, all centered around exploring and expressing my emotions and personal experiences.
