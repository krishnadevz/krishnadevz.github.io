Hi, I'm Krishna üëãüèª.

Hello, I'm Krishna and I'm based in Maharashtra, India. I am currently working on UX/UI, User Experience Research design projects and actively seeking UI/UX design jobs. As a designer, I am passionate about improving the lives of humans, and I always strive to learn something new on a daily basis.

The things I enjoy are design, writing, drawing, clicking pictures, and making videos.
