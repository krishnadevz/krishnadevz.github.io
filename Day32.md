**Day 32**

For the last couple of days, I am feeling restless and low, I feel like I am feeling the same as used to a few years back, 
today I am going to write some things that I haven't told anyone yet.
The reason for day 32 is that it’s been 32 days since I am jobless, it’s not like I am not doing anything i am learning UI/UX design which is a field of my interest and if I get time then I am doing photography also which I love doing.

Why I got into UI/UX design 
Growing up I was very curious about everything about the world. I have a different perspective to see things, somehow I stumbled upon photography, which I love. My interest in UI/UX design came from my desire to know how other people felt about something and to help them. That was one reason for me to go into the field.

Emotional Kid
This started in the year 2018 before that also I used to be an emotional kind of person, I always wanted to talk to folks but I didn’t I think I didn’t have confidence at that time because of that I think there were many things left incomplete.

In high school I used to like one girl I used to see her everywhere I feel like I framed her image in my brain but I think I really liked her back then.

Because of all these things I never really talked to many folks in college in 2018, so later than I suffered from loneliness & mental health issues, I always used to talk to myself & be in my own head, later then I started talking to a few folks, I started feeling good at that time also I used to write this kind of stuff like my feeling and emotions on Quora platform.

Eventually, I focused on my career. I got into development, and I stretched myself there, but somehow I knew that this was not what I had been looking for, later on, I did very well in my studies, and later on, I used to feel ill most of the time as a kid, and in this year, I was unable to attend college because I felt so sick, I lost so much weight.

I started to focus on my career two years later when the lockdown began. As a kid, we didn't have a great environment at home, which had an impact on my life, and later then, I participated in hackathons. In a few hackathons, I won prizes as well and wrote articles for the dev platform. It gave my mother and me good times like a hot summer cool breeze, it was a good time in that difficult time, at that time, we lost a couple of relatives, so it was a tough time. 
Also, we had some bad times at home because of some family issues my mother and I suffered a lot that was too bad.

Then I took a job with another company and I worked there for a few months, but I didn't do well there and I left that job.


Then after a few months, I joined another company where I worked for 1.3 years there I discover UI/UX design and here I faced a lot of problems.

A few months later in this job, I was feeling so down and low and also my mother is not at she went to her because my grandfather was sick, I went to one bar and I got drunk a lot and I started crying and shouting it was bad, I was crying so badly I felt too bad about it now I feel like crying about that now, later then I fall from that table and cried a lot a and then I started laughing and later again I cried a lot & then those people throw me out of that bar, that was too bad experience after that it’s been more than five months I am sober.


Later than four days later, we lost my grandfather, I went there and i saw my mother crying saying he's no more, you can’t see him anymore they’re gone forever at that time I was feeling pain and emotions but I couldn’t cry because of four days earlier I had the worst day,

**Numb to grief**

That broke my heart, I left everything behind.
I am currently working on projects and I am passionate about doing things that I find interesting and love, and I hope to make my mother happy by seeing what I am doing; I want to do the things I love doing, so if you are reading this, I hope you know how to cope with the things and live a good life.
